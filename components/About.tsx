        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Computer Technology</span> and working as
        an IT professional, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I
        enrolled in CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and learned{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">C, Phyton, JavaScript, SQL</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is <span className="font-medium">React, Next.js, Phyton and SQL</span>.
        I am also familiar with TypeScript. I am always looking to learn new
        technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Artificial Intelligence with Phyton</span>
        . I'm also learning how to play the piano.
